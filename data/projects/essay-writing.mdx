  <Title title="The Problem" />
  <Paragraph>
    Advanced students of foreign languages use tools that do not offer features that are useful to language learning, especially with regards to writing. If
    they want to write about articles with other people, they go on reddit. If they want to practice with their tutor, they use Google Docs. While these can get
    the job done, the same amount of effort can offer students much more value if it is used in a system that can keep track of their progress and build on top
    of their work rather than re-starting with each new google doc or reddit post.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    For example, with Google Docs each document is disconnected. You cannot keep track of which words used in one doc vs another, not with comments or feedback
    from a tutor. The words that are used, essays that are written, and the tutor feedback is extremely useful information that is lost after the essay is done.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    With this app, when a user creates a list of words they are learning in a book, writes an essay, or participates in a community post, they are constantly
    enriching a system that will exponentially increase their ability to write quality essays the more they use it.

  <Paragraph>The flow of writing essays:</Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    • Reads an article, book, C1 Work Book, etc
    <br />
    • Create a list of words from the reading
    <br />
    • Write an essay using these words
    <br />
    • Send the essay to the Tutor
    <br />
    • Tutor Marks words, correct, partially correct, or incorrect (with comments)
    <br />
    • The new state of these words is updated in their list
    <br />
    • Create a new essay. Pull in incorrect words, replace correct words with new ones
    <br />
    • Continue this cycle until all words have been used in an essay
  </Paragraph>

<Section id="book-reading">
  <Title title="Book Reading" />
  <Paragraph>
    Reading books in a foreign language is very daunting. At some point, in order to make forward progress you have to stop translating every word and just try
    to read the story. You can write down the words you don't know, but they all just end up as plain text in a document or on a sheet of paper.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    With this app, you can make a list and add all of these new words. If they exist in the dictionary the meanings and example sentences (from the dictionary
    or from other user essays with tutor feedback) are automatically generated. You can immediately start using the words. Definition with example sentences is
    automatically generated, then you're immediately given a chance to "activate" the vocabulary by using it in an essay.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Keep track of the context that you learned the word in (the book page / chapter). Keep track of ALL contexts you used it in (the essay for this book, but
    perhaps maybe again in a reddit post exercise with your tutor / fellow students, maybe a third time in a practice C1 exam essay - all of which are available
    in a single place to see side by side.
  </Paragraph>

<Section id="exam-prep">
  <Title title="Exam Preparation" />
  <Paragraph>
    DELF / DALF / IELTS / etc - Exam context-specific essay writing standards and vocabulary can be practiced. Student progress towards preparing for an exam
    can be more clearly measured (here are the 10 articles to read, the economics / politics / etc 200 words to practice. How many words or articles do they
    have left?)
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    If a tutor has many students that have already gone through the DALF C1 lists and articles before, all of their correct / incorrect marks, essays, and
    comments can provide a great amount of material and resources that can help new students grasp concepts faster.
  </Paragraph>
</Section>

<Section id="community-posts">
  <Title title="Community Post Activities" />
  <Paragraph>
    Have a reddit-like post with language learning features where students can engage together. They share the same tutor who can give them quality-controlled
    feedback on their comments.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>The Flow of community posts:</Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    • Students read the article
    <br />
    • Students create a list of the words they learned. (Their lists will vary from each others)
    <br />
    • Tutor creates a post and asks questions about the article.
    <br />
    • Students respond to the tutors question, and each other. As each student responds to the post and to each others comments, they use words and they are
    marked off the list as "used".
    <br />
    • Throughout the post, the tutor is marking words as used correctly and incorrectly, with comments.
    <br />
    • The goal is for every student by the end to have all of their words marked correctly by the tutor. Or maybe whoever has the most right "wins".
    <br />
    • The students' replies to the post and the mark they received on each word will be available in the dictionary, in their post history, as well as
    anytime they run into the word again.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    This creates an engaging activity for students to engage in with each other to practice their writing (better than google docs) that has high quality
    feedback on what they get wrong, based off of vocabulary they get from a specific context (better than reddit).
  </Paragraph>
</Section>

<Section id="dictionaries">
  <Title title="Dictionary" />
  <Paragraph>
    **Personal Dictionary**: As the user write essays, they start to build a "personal dictionary". Opening a word in the dictionary will show the essays where
    the word has been used, what the mark was and what the tutor comments were.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    **Community Dictionary**: Take this idea, and extend it to all of the users of the app, or just all of the students of a particular tutor. As students
    progress through the same articles and workbooks, they will run into the same words. They will use them in essays, and these usages with their marks and
    comments will be shown.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    But how will we keep quality control of the dictionary entries? Through tutor feedback on the associated essay/post. Tutors will be responsible for
    providing quality, or at the very least, accurate feedback. If there is no feedback for an entry then it will be marked with a warning.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    **Better Example Sentences**: Rather than the one-off sentences available to users in random dictionaries online, they will have entire paragraphs or essays
    available to them to understand the greater context for how a word is used.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    **Special Language Learning Features**: If a word is a false friend of their native language, that can be indicated. For example, if they look up
    "Prétendre", it will have a note that it is a false friend of "To Pretend". Bigger warning if using it the wrong way can have social consequences (je suis
    chaud / I'm hot).
  </Paragraph>

<Section id="summary">
  <Title title="In Summary" />
  <Paragraph>
    I would like to take all of the effort that students are already putting into increasing the quality of their writing and give it a catalyst. Rather than
    all of the valuable information of their word usage, marks, and tutor feedback disappearing after each essay, it will all be interconnected into a system
    that will continue to provide increased value the more they use it.
