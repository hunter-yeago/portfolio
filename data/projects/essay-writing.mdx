  <Title title="A Smarter Way to Learn Through Writing" />
  <Paragraph>
    Advanced students often rely on tools like Google Docs or Reddit to practice writing in a foreign language. These platforms can help with basic
    communication but fall short when it comes to structured learning and long-term growth. Essays, vocabulary, and tutor feedback are scattered and
    disconnected—every new piece of writing starts from scratch. No system remembers what words you’ve mastered or struggled with.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    This app addresses that by turning every student action—vocabulary list creation, essay writing, tutor correction—into meaningful progress. Words are
    tracked across essays, feedback is linked to usage history, and previous mistakes are recycled into future opportunities for growth. With every writing
    session, the user builds a richer dataset of personal learning information.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Instead of throwing away all the effort from one essay to the next, students compound their work. The more they write, the more useful the app becomes. It’s
    not just about writing better today—it’s about accelerating how quickly you can improve over time.

  <Title title="The Essay Flow: From Reading to Feedback Loop" />
  <Paragraph>
    Students start by reading something challenging—an article, a chapter from a novel, or a C1 exam prompt. As they encounter new vocabulary, they create a
    list. Then, they write an essay that intentionally incorporates those words. When submitted, a tutor marks the words as correct, partially correct, or
    incorrect, and can provide sentence-level feedback.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    The state of each word is then updated in the student’s vocabulary list. Future essays pull in old mistakes for another attempt, while mastered words are
    replaced by new ones. This closes a feedback loop that rewards progress and highlights areas that still need work. It mirrors how real fluency builds:
    through targeted repetition and meaningful use of words in context.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    By guiding the student through a purposeful cycle—read, write, get feedback, revise, repeat—the app ensures that every essay is more than just a one-off
    exercise. It’s part of a larger, personalized learning system.

<Section id="social-writing">
  <Title title="Beyond Google Docs: Social Writing With Real Feedback" />
  <Paragraph>
    In addition to private essays, students can participate in community posts—structured discussions similar to Reddit, but with educational scaffolding. A
    tutor posts an article or question. Students respond using words from their own vocabulary lists. As they engage with each other’s ideas, tutors track how
    words are used and provide corrections.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Each student’s progress is recorded: which words were used, which were correct, and what feedback was given. That history is stored in their personal
    dictionary, available anytime they revisit a word or write a new essay. Community interaction becomes more than just practice—it becomes data-rich, socially
    motivated vocabulary development.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    This is language learning that feels modern and social but remains deeply pedagogical. Writing with others, getting live feedback, and building something
    long-term from each contribution gives students a reason to return—and a way to see their progress evolve in real time.
  </Paragraph>

<Section id="dictionaries">
  <Title title="Personal & Community Dictionaries" />
  <Paragraph>
    Every word a student adds to a list or writes in an essay becomes part of their personal dictionary. The dictionary entry shows where the word was used,
    what feedback it received, and example sentences from real writing—not isolated textbook examples. This contextual history turns each word into something
    vivid and alive.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    The community dictionary builds on this idea. When many students are working through the same articles or word lists—like for the DALF C1—those shared
    experiences create a repository of usage examples, tutor feedback, and best practices. New students can learn from old corrections and see how others
    successfully used tricky words in context.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    To ensure quality, entries are only added when they are backed by tutor feedback. Unverified content is flagged until confirmed. This ensures the
    dictionaries remain accurate and educational, rather than a dumping ground of unchecked data. They become powerful tools for long-term retention and better
    writing.
