  Helped onboard my company from using only WordPress to a Next.js frontend with
  a headless WordPress backend. Problem: The old WordPress sites were slow and
  difficult to maintain. Next.js: The WordPress framework lacked reactivity,
  making it hard to manage and optimize. Our new sites are faster, handle state
  more efficiently with less code (e.g., showing different menus), and require
  significantly less time for QA. Tailwind: Maintaining SASS code became
  increasingly difficult after multiple iterations, requiring full-site QA for
  small updates. With Tailwind, we only need to QA the affected components.

I was project lead on several high-profile restaurant websites, including{" "}

  <strong>Joe's Live</strong> and <strong>Gussip & Dip</strong>, delivering
  projects on time and within budget. Beyond development, I worked directly
  with marketing teams to implement user insights via Google Analytics and Tag
  Manager.

  I created a custom PHP script that integrated Google Cloud CLI operations
  into our dev workflow, eliminating reliance on third-party GUI tools and
  reducing user error. This saved over 300 man-hours annually across the
  companyâ€™s web properties.

I also streamlined the integration of restaurant menu and location data into
WordPress using the ACF plugin. This reduced support tickets and empowered
marketing managers to make frontend edits without engineering intervention.

To enhance scalability, I designed custom Docker configurations and CI/CD
pipelines to speed up deployment and enable preview environments for
marketing and QA review.

  The project stack includes Next.js and React for frontend, PHP and WordPress
  for backend content management, and Tailwind CSS for design. I deployed to
  Google Cloud Platform using Docker containers and managed services like Cloud
  SQL and Bucket Storage. For data visualization and analytics, I implemented
  tracking using Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager.
