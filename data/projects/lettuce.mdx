  <Paragraph>
    As a fullstack web developer at Lettuce Entertain You, I led development and
    maintenance for over 40 restaurant websites using a combination of Next.js,
    PHP, and a headless WordPress CMS. I deployed infrastructure to Google Cloud
    Platform, ensuring reliability and scalability with services like Cloud Run,
    Load Balancers, Cloud SQL, and Bucket Storage. My work included responsive
    design and full accessibility compliance to ensure consistent user
    experiences across devices.

  Notes while I'm working on getting this thing to work ooooooooo"

Helped onboard my company from using only WordPress to a Next.js frontend with a headless WordPress backend.
Problem: The old WordPress sites were slow and difficult to maintain.
Next.js: The WordPress framework lacked reactivity, making it hard to manage and optimize. Our new sites are faster, handle state more efficiently with less code (e.g., showing different menus), and require significantly less time for QA.
Tailwind: Maintaining SASS code became increasingly difficult after multiple iterations, requiring full-site QA for small updates. With Tailwind, we only need to QA the affected components.

    I was project lead on several high-profile restaurant websites, including{" "}
    <strong>Joe's Live</strong> and <strong>Gussip & Dip</strong>, delivering
    projects on time and within budget. Beyond development, I worked directly
    with marketing teams to implement user insights via Google Analytics and Tag
    Manager.

  <Paragraph>
    I created a custom PHP script that integrated Google Cloud CLI operations into our dev workflow, eliminating reliance on third-party GUI tools and reducing
    user error. This saved over 300 man-hours annually across the companyâ€™s web properties.

    I also streamlined the integration of restaurant menu and location data into WordPress using the ACF plugin. This reduced support tickets and empowered
    marketing managers to make frontend edits without engineering intervention.

    To enhance scalability, I designed custom Docker configurations and CI/CD pipelines to speed up deployment and enable preview environments for marketing and
    QA review.

    The project stack includes Next.js and React for frontend, PHP and WordPress for backend content management, and Tailwind CSS for design. I deployed to
    Google Cloud Platform using Docker containers and managed services like Cloud SQL and Bucket Storage. For data visualization and analytics, I implemented
    tracking using Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager.
