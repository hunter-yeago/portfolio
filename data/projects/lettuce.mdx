    As a fullstack web developer at Lettuce Entertain You, I led development and maintenance for over 40 restaurant websites using a combination of Next.js,
    PHP, and a headless WordPress CMS. I deployed infrastructure to Google Cloud Platform, ensuring reliability and scalability with services like Cloud Run,
    Load Balancers, Cloud SQL, and Bucket Storage. My work included responsive design and full accessibility compliance to ensure consistent user experiences
    across devices.

    I was project lead on several high-profile restaurant websites, including <strong>Joe's Live</strong> and <strong>Gussip & Dip</strong>, delivering projects
    on time and within budget. Beyond development, I worked directly with marketing teams to implement user insights via Google Analytics and Tag Manager.

    I created a custom PHP script that integrated Google Cloud CLI operations into our dev workflow, eliminating reliance on third-party GUI tools and reducing
    user error. This saved over 300 man-hours annually across the companyâ€™s web properties.

    I also streamlined the integration of restaurant menu and location data into WordPress using the ACF plugin. This reduced support tickets and empowered
    marketing managers to make frontend edits without engineering intervention.

    To enhance scalability, I designed custom Docker configurations and CI/CD pipelines to speed up deployment and enable preview environments for marketing and
    QA review.
