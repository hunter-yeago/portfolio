    69% of emissions in Chicago come from buildings according to the 2022 Chicago Climate Action Plan.{" "}

    project led by <SectionLink text="Viktor Köves" link="https://viktorkoves.com/" />
    that transforms data into easy to understand analysis and charts so Chicagoans can understand the impact of their buildings on the climate.

  <Paragraph>
    I am currently working on the City-Wide statistics page, which will give a year over year analysis of the greenhouse gas emissions and other statistics for
    all of the buildings we have data for.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>I used Pandas to take our existing data and organize it by year, pass that data to Vue and render out the information with D3.</Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    The current version only does all buildings but the next step is to make it so that it can be broken down by building type (mixed residential, healthcare,
    College, Data Center, etc). Once setting up the Pandas data pipeline, I sent that over to my graphs I made in D3 and rendered them to the screen!
