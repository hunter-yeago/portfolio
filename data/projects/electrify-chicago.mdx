    <SectionLink text="Electrify Chicago" link="https://electrifychicago.net/" /> is an independent open-source{" "}
    <SectionLink text="Chi Hack Night" link="https://chihacknight.org/" /> project led by <SectionLink text="Viktor Köves" link="https://viktorkoves.com/" />
    looking to shed light onto one of the biggest sources of Chicago's CO2 emissions - buildings. By providing more information about some of the city's largest
    and most polluting buildings, we hope to encourage these buildings to electrify, particularly by mobilizing people related to the building - whether that be
    students and faculty for a college building or employees and patients at a hospital.

    According to the 2022 <SectionLink text="Chicago Climate Action Plan" link="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/climate-action-plan/home.html" />,{" "}
    <strong>69% of Chicago's emissions come from buildings</strong>, making building emissions our biggest challenge and our biggest opportunity as a city to
    tackle climate change. At Electrify Chicago, we showcase building performance using publicly available data supplemented by community-submitted photographs
    and building owners.{" "}

    and other statistics for all of the buildings we have data for. I used
    Pandas to take our existing data and organize it by year, pass that data to
    Vue and render out the information with D3.

    The current version only does all buildings but the next step is to make it
    so that it can be broken down by building type (mixed residential,
    healthcare, College, Data Center, etc). Once setting up the Pandas data
    pipeline, I sent that over to my graphs I made in D3 and rendered them to
    the screen!
