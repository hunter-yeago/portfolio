        {
          "information": "Advanced students often rely on tools like Google Docs or Reddit to practice writing in a foreign language. These platforms can help with basic communication but fall short when it comes to structured learning and long-term growth. Essays, vocabulary, and tutor feedback are scattered and disconnected—every new piece of writing starts from scratch. No system remembers what words you’ve mastered or struggled with."
        },
        {
          "information": "This app addresses that by turning every student action—vocabulary list creation, essay writing, tutor correction—into meaningful progress. Words are tracked across essays, feedback is linked to usage history, and previous mistakes are recycled into future opportunities for growth. With every writing session, the user builds a richer dataset of personal learning information."
        },
        {
          "information": "Instead of throwing away all the effort from one essay to the next, students compound their work. The more they write, the more useful the app becomes. It’s not just about writing better today—it’s about accelerating how quickly you can improve over time."

      "title": "The Essay Flow: From Reading to Feedback Loop",
      "text": [
        {
          "information": "Students start by reading something challenging—an article, a chapter from a novel, or a C1 exam prompt. As they encounter new vocabulary, they create a list. Then, they write an essay that intentionally incorporates those words. When submitted, a tutor marks the words as correct, partially correct, or incorrect, and can provide sentence-level feedback.",

          }
        },
        {
          "information": "The state of each word is then updated in the student’s vocabulary list. Future essays pull in old mistakes for another attempt, while mastered words are replaced by new ones. This closes a feedback loop that rewards progress and highlights areas that still need work. It mirrors how real fluency builds: through targeted repetition and meaningful use of words in context."
        },
        {
          "information": "By guiding the student through a purposeful cycle—read, write, get feedback, revise, repeat—the app ensures that every essay is more than just a one-off exercise. It’s part of a larger, personalized learning system."

      "text": [
        {
          "information": "In addition to private essays, students can participate in community posts—structured discussions similar to Reddit, but with educational scaffolding. A tutor posts an article or question. Students respond using words from their own vocabulary lists. As they engage with each other’s ideas, tutors track how words are used and provide corrections."
        },
        {
          "information": "Each student’s progress is recorded: which words were used, which were correct, and what feedback was given. That history is stored in their personal dictionary, available anytime they revisit a word or write a new essay. Community interaction becomes more than just practice—it becomes data-rich, socially motivated vocabulary development."
        },
        {
          "information": "This is language learning that feels modern and social but remains deeply pedagogical. Writing with others, getting live feedback, and building something long-term from each contribution gives students a reason to return—and a way to see their progress evolve in real time."

          "information": "Every word a student adds to a list or writes in an essay becomes part of their personal dictionary. The dictionary entry shows where the word was used, what feedback it received, and example sentences from real writing—not isolated textbook examples. This contextual history turns each word into something vivid and alive."
        },
        {
          "information": "The community dictionary builds on this idea. When many students are working through the same articles or word lists—like for the DALF C1—those shared experiences create a repository of usage examples, tutor feedback, and best practices. New students can learn from old corrections and see how others successfully used tricky words in context.",
